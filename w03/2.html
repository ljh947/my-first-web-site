<h2>Inorganic chemistry</h2>
<img src="inorganic.png" width="50%" alt="CSS image">
<p><strong><u>Inorganic chemistry</u></strong> deals with synthesis and behavior of <u>inorganic and organometallic compounds.</u> This field covers chemical compounds that are not carbon-based, which are the subjects of organic chemistry. The distinction between the two disciplines is far from absolute, as there is much overlap in the subdiscipline of organometallic chemistry. It has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry, including catalysis, materials science, pigments, surfactants, coatings, medications, fuels, and agriculture.</p>
<p style="margin-top:40px">Inorganic compounds are found in nature as minerals. Soil may contain iron sulfide as pyrite or calcium sulfate as gypsum. Inorganic compounds are also found multitasking as biomolecules: as electrolytes (sodium chloride), in energy storage (ATP) or in construction (the polyphosphate backbone in DNA).</p>
